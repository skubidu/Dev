# Advantages and Disadvantages - Linear Regression

## Anvantages

- Simple and efficient.
- Easily interpretable.
- Low variance ML model.
- Easy to implement as compared other complex ML approaches.
- If the relationshiop between the independet and dependet variable have a linear relationship, this algorithm is the best to use because it's the least complex as compared to other ML methods.

## Disadvantages

- It requires tranformation of non-linear features.
- Non-linear interactions between predictors are not captured.
- L-R method can be very sensitve to the presence of outlier.
- Cannot automatically take care of missing information.
- Not quite flexible towards capturing more complex relationship between predictors.
