# Chapter 1: Understanding Kubernetes Architecture

- big OpenSource project
- made by Google 
- joined **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**

## What is Kubernetes?

- platform that encompasses a guhe number of services and capabilities that keep growing
- core functionality is to schedule workloads in containers across infrastructure
    + Mounting storage systems
    + Distributing secrets
    + Chcekcing appication health
    + Replicanting application instances
    + Using horizontal pod autoscaling
    + Naming an discovering 
    + Balancing loads
    + Rolling updates
    + Monitoring resources
    + accessing and ingesting logs
    + Debugging applications 
    + Providing authentications and authorization

## What Kubernates is not
   
   - Kubernetes is not a **platform as a service (PaaS)**
       + Kubernetes doesn't require specific applications type or framework
       + KÃ¼bernetes doesn't requie specific programming language
       + Kubernetes doesn't privide dtabeses or messages queues
       + Kubernetes doesn't distinguish apps from services
       + Kubernetes dosen't have a click-to-deploy service marketplace
       + Kubernetes allows unsers to choose their own logging, monitoring, and alerting systems

## Understanding container orchestration

- Primary responsibility of Kubernetes is container orchestration
- make  sure that all the containers that execute varous workloads are scheduled to run on physical or virtual machines
- Kubernetes muss keep an eye on all running containers and replace dead, unresponsive, or otherwise unhealthy containers

### Physical machines, virtual machines, and containers

- starts and ends with hardware
- in order to run workloads, you need some real hardware 
- physical machines with certain CPU and cores, memory and local persistend storage
- and some shared persistent storage and the networking to hook up all thses machines so they can find and talk to each other
- you can run mulitple virtual machines on the physical machines or stay at the bare-metal level
- Kubernetes ca be deployed on bare metal cluster or on a cluster of virtual machines
- Kubernetes in turn can orchestrate the containers it manages directly on bare-metal or virtual macines
- Kibernetes cluster can be compsed of a mix of bare-metal and virtual machines, but this ist not very common

### The benefits of containers

- Containers represent a true pardigm shift in the development and operations of large, complicated software systems
    + Agile application creation and deployment
    + Continuous development, integration, and deployment
    + Dev and ops seperation of concerns
    + Environmental consistency across develpment, testing, and production
    + Cloud- and OS-distribution protability
    + Application-centric management
    + Loosely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated microservices
    + Resource isolation
    + Resource utilization

### Containers in the cloud

- Containers are ideal to package microsecices 
- while providing isolation to the microservice, they are very lightweight
- all major cloud providers (AWS, GCE, Azure, Alibaba Cloud) privide a container-hosting service
- Goolge's GKE always been based on Kubernetes
- AES eCS is based on their own orchestration solution
- Microsoft Azure was based on Apache Mesos
- Kubernetes can be deployed on all cloud platforms
- end 2017 all cloud providers announced direct support for Kubernetes
- Microsoft launched AKS
- AWS released EKS
- Alibaba Cloud started working on a Kibernetes controller manager

### Cattle versus pets

- in older days, when systems were small, each server had a nahme
- developers and users knew exactly what software was running on each machine
- you treated your servers like beloved pets
- when a server died, it was a major crisis
- when you have a few tens or hundreds of servers, you start treating them like cattle
- you thing about the collective and not the individuals
- Kubernetes takes the catlle approach to the extreme and takes full responsibility for allcoationg containers to specific machines
- You don't need to interact with individual machines (nodes) most of the time
- This work best for stateless worklaods
- For stateful applications, the situation is a little different 
- Kbernetes provides a solution called StatefulSet

## Kubernetes concepts

- briefly intoduce many important Kubernetes concept
- give some context as to why they are needed and how they interact with oter concepts
